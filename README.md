## Documentation

### Getting up and running

With `ni` (recommended) ([link](https://github.com/antfu/ni))

```bash
ni && nr dev
```

With pnpm

```bash
pnpm install && pnpn run dev
```

This will start a development server watching the translations as well as the source files for changes.

### Translating source code

The code is written directly in the target language. You'll often not need an english translation. This saves time and effort. So instead of

```typescript
const hw = $t("helloWorld");

//en.json
{ "helloWorld": "Hello World" }
//fr.json
{ "helloWorld": "Bonjour Monde" }
```

You can do:

```typescript
const hw = $t("Hello World");

//fr.json
{ "Hello World": "Bonjour Monde" }
```

Note that although the second is shorter, if you prefer to use the second way, it is also perfectly valid!

Sometimes however, you'll have to use keys. There's typically 3 reasons you'd want to do so:

- Reason 1: plurals and gender rules

```svelte
<!-- Component.svelte -->
<p>{$t("interpolated", {count: 10 })}</p>
<p>{$t("selected", {gender: "male"})}</p>
```

```json
// en.json
{
    "interpolated": "A text where I interpolate {count} times",
    "selected": "{gender, select, male {He is a good boy} female {She is a good girl} other {They are good fellas}}"
}
```

See [messageformat's documentation](http://messageformat.github.io/messageformat/) for details about the translation format.

- Reason 2: Long and multiline strings

🚫 DON'T:

```svelte
<!-- Component.svelte -->
<p>{$t("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor...")}</p>
<p>{$t(`Multiline string
    that spans
    multiple
    lines`)}</p>
```

Translation nightmare

👍 DO:

```svelte
<p>{$t("loremIpsum")}</p>
<p>{$t(`multiline`)}</p>
```

```json
// en.json
{
    "loremIpsum": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor...",
    "multiline": "Multiline string\nthat spans\nmultiple\nlines"
}
```

Note: you can use yaml ([and soon json5 🤞🤞🤞](https://github.com/messageformat/messageformat/pull/345)) and all other formats supported by messageformat.

Note2: Nested keys are not allowed, and are not planned to be.

## Known issues

Note that messageformat has a bug under Windows, [which has now been fixed](https://github.com/messageformat/messageformat/issues/343), but hasn't been published yet. Until a release comes out, using this repo under Windows is troublesome. For those it concerns, try [github codespaces](github.com/codespaces).
